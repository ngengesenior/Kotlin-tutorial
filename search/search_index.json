If you are from a Java background, you will notice the similarities and differences that exist between the two languages. Variables Kotlin has two ways of declaring variables; using the val and var keywords. Val is an immutable value, which means once assigned, it cannot be reassigned. It is similar to a final variable in Java . Var on the otherhand, is a mutable value, meaning you can reassign later to a different value. val pi = 3.142 var age = 20 You can even declare a var and assign it later, unlike val which must be assigned a final value. var name:String name = \"Mary Doe\" Automatic Type Inference With Java and some other languages, you must declare a variable's type before using or assigning it.If you noticed above, we initialized age to 20 without telling Kotlin that it should be an Int .Kotlin automatically infers the type for you.Thus, the following two declarations are the same. var age:Int = 20 var age = 20 Type System If you are from a Java background, you understand that Java has the notion of primitive types like int,boolean,float,long,double etc and typen wrapper classes such as Integer,Boolean,Float,Long,Double respectively. Primitive types cannot be assigned null . In Kotlin, the story changes; as everything is an object. The various data types in Kotlin include numbers, characters,strings,collections etc. The number types are as follows Int: 32 bytes long Float: 32 bytes long Long: 64 bytes long Double: 64 bytes long Short: 16 bytes long Byte: 8 bytes long There is also Char String and Collections Code snippet of the various mentioned types above can be seen here var anInt:Int = 20 var aFloat:Float = 2.3F var aLong:Long = 1234L var aDouble = 1.2345 var aShort = 12 var aByte = 13 var aChar:Char = 'A' var aString:String = \"Kotlin rocks!\" Type Conversion In Kotlin, converting from type A to type B requires invoking a.toB ; //Conversion between types val a = 12 //Int val b = 1.23f //Float val c = a.toFloat() //Convert from Int to Float val d = b.toDouble() //Convert b to Double Break Let us get a break and do some little practical work Example The diameter of certain circular Github sticker is 10mm. Write a program that prints the circumference and the area of the sticker im mm and mm^2 /** * Created by ngenge on 11/23/18. */ fun main(args: Array<String>) { val pi = Math.PI //The PI constant from java.lang package val diameter = 10 val radius = diameter/2 val circumference = diameter * radius val area = radius.times(radius) * pi println(\"The circumference is $circumference\") println(\"The area is $area\") }","title":"Kotlin Basics"},{"location":"basics/#kotlin-basics","text":"In this section, you will learn the basic building blocks of Kotlin starting from variables, to data types, type inference, and more.

In Kotlin, a function always returns a value Declaring functions Functions in Kotlin are declared as follows fun function_name(param1:type1,param2:type2,.... ,paramn:typen):return type A quick example of a function that prints the classical , \"Hello World!\", will be like this; fun sayHello(){ println(\"Hello World!\") } The above function takes no parameters and returns type Unit.Unit is corresponds to void in Java. Now a function that takes two parameters and returns a value demonstrated thus; fun welomeStudent(name:String,id:String):String{ return \"Welcome $name. Your student id is $id\" } Calling functions Functions in Kotlin are called the same way like most languages. <function name>(arg1,arg2,..argn) Calling the above functions can be done as follows sayHello() welcomeStudent(\"John Doe\",\"HF1234\") Now the beauty of Kotlin in functions come in when we can call functions using named parameters as follows, welcomeStudent(id=\"HF123\",name=\"Mary Doe\") Imagine a functions with 20+ parameters; with Java and other languages, you must know the order in which the parameters are passed before calling the function.This is really not easy to retain. With named parameters, you don't have to know the order in which those parameters are passed. Functions with Single Expressions We can write a function that does addition of two integers and return the value as follows; fun add(a:Int,b:Int):Int { return a+ b } The above function is a single expression function. The single expression function can be simplified further as follows. fun add(a:Int,b:Int) = a + b As you might have noticed, we ommitted the return type because Kotlin will automatically infer the return type to be Int . Functions with default values Another awesome part of Kotlin is that it gives you the ability to give default values to your parameters. Let us take a real example. Say you are developing an app with two types of users, when user provides name, he/she is a regular user, but if not, they are anonymous. fun greetUser(name:String = \"Anonymous user\",userId:Int = 0) { println(\"Welcome $name. Your user id is $userId\") } The function can be called in the following ways. greetUser() // prints Welcome Anonymous user. Your userid is 0 greetUser(\"Ngenge Senior\")// Prints , Welcome Ngenge Senior. Your user id is 0 greetUser(name=\"Romeo\", userId=3) //Works as expected greetUser(userId=2,name=\"Julliet\")","title":"Functions"},{"location":"functions/#functions-and-lambdas","text":"A function is a named block of code that performs a particular task.
